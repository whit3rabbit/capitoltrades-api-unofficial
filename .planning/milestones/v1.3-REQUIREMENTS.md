## Future Requirements (Not in v1.3 scope)

### Advanced Analytics

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time alerting | 30-day disclosure delay makes real-time detection impractical |
| Machine learning models | Over-engineering for CLI; simple statistics sufficient for N<50 samples |
| Causal inference claims | Cannot prove insider trading from public data; present as correlation only |
| Web dashboard | CLI-first; defer to separate milestone |
| Option trade analytics | Option valuation requires strike/expiry data not available from CapitolTrades |
