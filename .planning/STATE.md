# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-11)

**Current focus:** v1.2 FEC Donation Integration -- Phase 7 next

## Current Position

Phase: 7 of 12 (Foundation & Environment Setup)
Plan: -- (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-11 -- Roadmap created, requirements defined

Progress: [..........] 0% (0/6 v1.2 phases)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (from v1.1):**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 4.4 min
- Total execution time: 0.52 hours

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
No pending decisions for v1.2 yet.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 9 research flag: CapitolTrades politician_id format needs investigation to determine crosswalk strategy (Bioguide ID vs proprietary). Validate with 5-10 real politician records.
- Phase 12 research flag: Employer fuzzy matching thresholds need empirical tuning with real FEC data.
- OpenFEC rate limit ambiguity: 100 vs 1,000 calls/hour needs empirical verification via X-RateLimit-Limit headers during Phase 8 development.
